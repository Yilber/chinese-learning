## Background

Initially the purpose of this project was to make a simple website where I could talk about myself and my school or side projects. Every time I was applying for an internship, they asked if I had a project that I could show them. The problem was that I didnt have a github account with my projects or anything I could show. As a result, I started working on the first version of my personal portfolio.
